I am interested improving policymaking using data science. As an analyst at the Federal Reserve Board, I have built a diverse portfolio of research experience, technical expertise, and teaching materials. My research includes work on international trade, graph neural networks, natural language processing, and more. I am experienced with technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, Impala, TensorFlow, PyTorch, spaCy, NLTK, and R.
