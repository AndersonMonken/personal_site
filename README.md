# personal_site

How to update site once you have confirmed that edits work using local tests:

1. In RStudio, run the command ```blogdown::build_site()```
2. Copy public folder contents to AndersonMonken.github.io repo (not the folder itself)
3. Git add and commit these files then push to GitHub
4. Check www.andersonmonken.github.io that the site works
